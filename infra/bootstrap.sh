# Difference vs deploy.sh:
# this script operates on the entire compose stack, not only on webapp.
# It is useful for the first bootstrap of a server or when you intentionally
# want to refresh backing services too.

# Recreate the full stack and remove stale orphaned containers.
# This may restart infrastructure containers as well, so it is broader and
# potentially more disruptive than deploy.sh.
